# MAL-to-JSON
This is a project that I made for CSCI 355 at Queens College but never uploaded to github. The purpose is to showcase knowledge of JavaScript and APIs. It fetches data from MyAnimeList (based on the keyword provided by the user) and saves it as a JSON object in the user's JSONBin account.
